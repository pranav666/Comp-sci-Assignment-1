## This is Why I Like Tennis
Tennis is really fun to play. And I guess I am better at it than other people. So , maybe that is why I really like it. I think that it is an active sport that you need a lot of technique in. It's not a sport that you can master without practice. 
## Why I hate Tennis
I hate tennis because it is boring to watch. I think that it is boring to watch on TV because it isn't too engaging like other sports in my opinion.
